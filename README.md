# practicalA5

A package providing a nested function demo showing how you write complex functions, and then simpler functions that use limited aspects
of the more complex functions.

See, for instance [`muladdpow()`](R/muladdpow.R), which is then used by [`muladd()`](R/muladd.R), which is used in turn by
[`mul()`](R/mul.R) and [`add()`](R/add.R).
